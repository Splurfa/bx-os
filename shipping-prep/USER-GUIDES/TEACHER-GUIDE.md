# Teacher User Guide

## Overview

As a teacher using BX-OS, you can quickly create Behavioral Support Requests (BSRs) that automatically assign students to available reflection kiosks. This guide covers the complete teacher workflow from BSR creation through completion monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Teacher Dashboard
1. **Navigate to**: `[your-domain]/teacher-dashboard`
2. **Login**: Click "Sign in with Google" using your school Google account
3. **Verify access**: You should see the teacher dashboard with BSR creation tools

### Teacher Dashboard Layout
- **Create BSR Button**: Quick access to start new behavioral support requests
- **Active Queue**: Real-time view of your submitted BSRs and their status
- **Recent Activity**: History of completed reflections
- **Notification Area**: Alerts when students complete their reflections

## Creating Behavioral Support Requests (BSRs)

### Step-by-Step BSR Creation

#### 1. Initiate BSR Creation
- **Click "Create BSR"** button on teacher dashboard
- **BSR creation modal** will open with student search

#### 2. Select Student
- **Search by name**: Type student first or last name
- **Search by ID**: Enter student ID number
- **Filter results**: Only middle school students (6th, 7th, 8th grade) will appear
- **Select student**: Click on correct student from search results

#### 3. Choose Behavior Category
Select the appropriate behavior that prompted the BSR:
- **Defiance/Disrespect**: Direct refusal to follow directions or disrespectful behavior
- **Disruption**: Behaviors that interfere with learning environment
- **Inappropriate Language**: Use of profanity or inappropriate communication
- **Physical Aggression**: Any form of physical confrontation or aggression
- **Other**: Any behavior not covered by standard categories

#### 4. Add Context (Optional)
- **Brief description**: Add specific details about the incident
- **Location information**: Where the behavior occurred
- **Time context**: When the incident happened
- **Additional notes**: Any relevant background information

#### 5. Submit BSR
- **Review information**: Double-check student and behavior selection
- **Click "Submit BSR"**: Request will be added to the queue
- **Confirmation**: You'll see the BSR appear in your active queue

### Understanding BSR Status

#### Status Indicators
- **Pending**: BSR created, waiting for kiosk assignment
- **Assigned**: Student assigned to specific kiosk (Kiosk 1, 2, or 3)
- **In Progress**: Student actively completing reflection
- **Completed**: Student finished reflection and returned to class

#### Queue Position
- **Position number**: Shows student's place in line for next available kiosk
- **Estimated wait time**: Approximate time until kiosk assignment
- **Real-time updates**: Position updates automatically as other students complete

## Monitoring Student Progress

### Active Queue Monitoring
- **Real-time updates**: Queue status refreshes automatically
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status for quick recognition
- **Time stamps**: When BSR was created and status last updated
- **Kiosk assignment**: Which specific kiosk student is using

### Completion Notifications
- **Audio alerts**: Optional sound notification when student completes reflection
- **Visual notifications**: Dashboard badge updates with completion status
- **Summary information**: Brief overview of student's reflection completion

### Student Return Process
- **Completion notification**: You'll be alerted when student finishes
- **Return timing**: Student should return to class within 5 minutes of completion
- **Follow-up**: Consider brief check-in with student about reflection experience

## Best Practices

### When to Create BSRs
**Appropriate situations:**
- Behavior that requires immediate reflection and cooling-off period
- Incidents that need documentation for administrative review
- Patterns of behavior that benefit from structured reflection
- Situations where student needs time to process their actions

**Consider alternatives for:**
- Minor, first-time behaviors that can be addressed through classroom management
- Behaviors that require immediate administrative intervention
- Medical or crisis situations requiring nurse or counselor involvement

### Effective BSR Creation
1. **Be specific**: Choose the most accurate behavior category
2. **Provide context**: Brief notes help kiosk reflection be more targeted
3. **Timing matters**: Create BSRs promptly after incidents for best results
4. **Student communication**: Let student know they're going to reflection, not punishment

### Queue Management Tips
- **Monitor queue length**: Be aware of current wait times
- **Consider timing**: Avoid creating BSRs right before transitions or specials
- **Emergency situations**: Contact administration directly for urgent behavioral needs
- **Student preparation**: Briefly explain reflection process to reduce anxiety

## Common Scenarios

### Typical Workflow Timeline
1. **Incident occurs** (0 minutes)
2. **BSR created** (2-3 minutes after incident)
3. **Student assigned to kiosk** (immediately if available, up to 10 minutes if queue)
4. **Student walks to kiosk** (2-3 minutes)
5. **Reflection completed** (8-12 minutes on kiosk)
6. **Student returns to class** (2-3 minutes)
7. **Total time**: 15-20 minutes average

### Multiple Students
- **Separate BSRs**: Create individual BSR for each student involved
- **Behavior categorization**: May be different categories for different students
- **Queue assignment**: Students will be assigned to different kiosks when possible
- **Staggered returns**: Students may return at different times

### Priority Situations
- **Standard queue**: Most BSRs processed in order received
- **Administrative override**: Admin can prioritize urgent situations
- **Emergency protocols**: Severe behaviors should involve administration directly
- **Medical needs**: Students with health concerns should see nurse first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Student Not Found in Search
- **Check spelling**: Verify correct name or ID spelling
- **Confirm grade level**: Only 6th, 7th, 8th grade students appear
- **Database refresh**: Contact admin if student should be available
- **Manual entry**: Ask admin to check student database

#### BSR Not Submitting
- **Network connection**: Check internet connectivity
- **Browser refresh**: Reload page and try again
- **Clear cache**: Clear browser data if persistent issues
- **Contact admin**: Report technical issues for resolution

#### Student Doesn't Appear at Kiosk
- **Check assignment**: Verify student was assigned to correct kiosk
- **Location confirmation**: Ensure student knows which kiosk to use
- **Time factor**: Allow 3-5 minutes for student to locate and reach kiosk
- **Alternative routing**: Student may need directions to kiosk area

#### Queue Not Updating
- **Automatic refresh**: Page should update automatically every few seconds
- **Manual refresh**: Use browser refresh button
- **Network issues**: Check internet connection
- **Technical support**: Contact admin if problems persist

### Emergency Procedures
- **Immediate behavioral crisis**: Contact administration and security directly
- **Technical system failure**: Revert to traditional paper-based documentation
- **Student refuses to go to kiosk**: Handle as standard defiance, contact admin
- **Kiosk area unavailable**: Admin can redirect students to alternative kiosks
