## 📋 What Is This App?

The **Behavior Support Request System** is a digital tool designed to help schools manage student behavioral incidents in a supportive, structured way. Instead of traditional disciplinary approaches, this system focuses on **reflection and learning** to help students understand their actions and make positive changes.

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

**Clear Queue Broken**: Queue clearing appears successful but records persist in database
- **File**: `src/hooks/useSupabaseQueue.ts` (lines 534-607)
- **Impact**: Cannot test full workflow, blocks production
- **Status**: 4 behavior_requests remain after "successful" clear operations
- **Priority**: MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

**📋 Complete handoff documentation available in project root and /docs folder**

### 🏫 Perfect For:
- **Elementary & Middle Schools** looking to modernize behavior management
- **Administrators** who want real-time oversight of behavioral incidents
- **Teachers** who need an efficient way to document and follow up on student behaviors
- **Students** who benefit from guided reflection and learning opportunities

## ⚙️ How It Works

Our system creates a simple **3-step workflow** that turns behavioral incidents into learning opportunities:

### **Step 1: Teacher Reports** 📝
- Teacher notices a behavioral issue
- Creates a digital behavior report quickly
- Selects student, behavior type, and adds context
- System immediately notifies relevant parties

### **Step 2: Student Reflects** 🤔  
- Student uses a dedicated kiosk or tablet
- Completes a guided 4-question reflection:
  - What happened?
  - How did others feel?
  - What could you do differently?
  - What's your plan moving forward?
- Responses are saved automatically

### **Step 3: Teacher Reviews** ✅
- Teacher receives the student's reflection instantly
- Can approve the reflection or request more detail
- Tracks progress and patterns over time
- Closes the incident when satisfied

**🔄 Everything happens in real-time** - no waiting, no paperwork delays!
