# 🎯 Behavior Support Request (BSR) System

## 📋 What Is This App?

The **Behavior Support Request System** is a digital tool designed to help schools manage student behavioral incidents in a supportive, structured way.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Our system creates a simple **3-step workflow** that turns behavioral incidents into learning opportunities:

### **Step 1: Teacher Reports** 📝

- Creates a digital behavior report in 2 minutes
- Selects student, behavior type, and adds context
- System immediately notifies relevant parties

### **Step 2: Student Reflects** 🤔  
- Student uses a dedicated kiosk or tablet
- Completes a guided 4-question reflection:
  - What happened?
  - How did others feel?
  - What could you do differently?
  - What's your plan moving forward?
- Responses are saved automatically

### **Step 3: Teacher Reviews** ✅
- Teacher receives the student's reflection instantly
- Can approve the reflection or request more detail
- Tracks progress and patterns over time
- Closes the incident when satisfied

**🔄 Everything happens in real-time** - no waiting, no paperwork delays!
