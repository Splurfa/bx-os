## üèóÔ∏è CURRENT STATE ARCHITECTURE

### Authentication Domain
**Current State:**
- Password-only authentication via `AuthContext.tsx`
- No domain restriction (@school.edu)
- Kiosks blocked by authentication wall
- No `super_admin` role exists
- Basic email/password flow only

**Technical Issues:**
- `ProtectedRoute` wraps all kiosk routes (`/kiosk1`, `/kiosk2`, `/kiosk3`)
- Auth state stored in React context only
- No role-based authentication logic
- Missing Google OAuth integration
- No development bypass for super admin

### Role & Permissions Domain
**Current State:**
- Two roles: `teacher`, `admin` in profiles table
- Hardcoded role checks in components
- No `super_admin` role for Zach
- Basic RLS policies without role differentiation
- No role-based UI rendering

**Technical Issues:**
- Missing role hierarchy system
- No granular permission system
- Routes not role-aware beyond basic auth
- Admin vs teacher UI identical

### Routing & Landing Domain
**Current State:**
- All routes redirect to `/auth` when unauthenticated
- No role-based landing page logic
- `/` route always shows `AuthPage`
- Static routing without dynamic role detection

**Technical Issues:**
- Missing role-aware entry point logic
- No automatic routing based on user role
- Landing page doesn't adapt to user context

### Kiosk Access Domain
**Current State:**
- Kiosks require authentication (`ProtectedRoute` wrapper)
- Cannot function as intended for student use
- No anonymous access capability
- Authentication wall prevents tablet/kiosk functionality

**Technical Issues:**
- Critical blocker for classroom implementation
- Students cannot access reflection system
- Kiosks non-functional in production context

### User Interface Domain
**Current State:**
- Desktop-first responsive design
- Button-based navigation (no mobile gestures)
- No notification system
- No tutorial/onboarding system
- Missing mobile-first interaction patterns

**Technical Issues:**
- iPhone gesture support missing
- No swipe-based navigation
- Touch targets too small
- No progressive disclosure patterns

### Notification Domain
**Current State:**
- No notification system exists
- No real-time alert mechanism
- No bell icon in headers
- No queue update notifications

**Technical Issues:**
- Missing notification infrastructure
- No real-time communication for updates
- Teachers unaware of queue changes

### Security Domain
**Current State:**
- Basic RLS policies implemented
- No domain-restricted authentication
- Development and production environments mixed
- No role-based access granularity

**Technical Issues:**
- Missing production security measures
- No domain validation for Google OAuth
- Insufficient access control layers

### Mobile/Touch Domain
**Current State:**
- Responsive but not mobile-first
- No touch-optimized interactions
- Missing swipe gestures
- No native mobile patterns

**Technical Issues:**
- Poor mobile user experience
- No gesture recognition
- Touch targets insufficient for tablets

## üéØ FUTURE STATE ARCHITECTURE

### Authentication Domain
**Production Requirements:**
```typescript
// Authentication Flow
- Google OAuth restricted to @school.edu domain
- Password authentication as fallback
- Development bypass: /dev-login for super_admin
- Kiosk routes: NO AUTHENTICATION required
- Role-aware authentication flows
```

**Implementation Specifications:**
- Supabase Google OAuth with domain restriction
- `/dev-login` route for development access
- `AuthContext` enhanced with role detection
- Remove `ProtectedRoute` from kiosk paths
- Implement role-based authentication redirects

### Role & Permissions Domain
**Production Requirements:**
```typescript
// Role Hierarchy
- super_admin: Zach (zach@zavitechllc.com) - full system access
- admin: School administrators - manage users, access kiosks for testing
- teacher: Classroom teachers - create BSRs, manage queue, review reflections
```

**Implementation Specifications:**
- Add `super_admin` role to database enum
- Implement role hierarchy checks in RLS
- Create role-based UI component rendering
- Develop permission matrix system
- Add role-aware navigation components

### Routing & Landing Domain
**Production Requirements:**
```typescript
// Role-Based Landing Logic
- super_admin ‚Üí /admin-dashboard (system management)
- admin ‚Üí /admin-dashboard (school management)
- teacher ‚Üí /teacher (classroom management)
- unauthenticated ‚Üí /auth (login/signup)
```

**Implementation Specifications:**
- Smart entry point at `/` with role detection
- Automatic routing based on user role
- Role-specific dashboard components
- Navigation guards with role verification

### Kiosk Access Domain
