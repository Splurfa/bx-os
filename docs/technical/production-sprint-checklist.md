**Duration:** 24-hour implementation sprint  
**Objective:** Transform BX-OS from prototype to production-ready system  
**Success Criteria:** All critical functionality operational for classroom deployment

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Documentation-First Approach
**MANDATORY:** Review these documents before starting any task:
- `BX-OS-PRODUCTION-KNOWLEDGE.md` - Master system knowledge
- `docs/architecture/transformation-blueprint.md` - Technical specifications  
- `docs/technical/testing-verification-protocol.md` - **MANDATORY TESTING REQUIREMENTS**
- This checklist - Current task context and progress

### Testing & Verification Protocol (BLOCKING)
**CRITICAL:** Follow `docs/technical/testing-verification-protocol.md` requirements:
- **Test-First Planning:** Define verification before implementation
- **Incremental Testing:** Verify each component as built  
- **Proof-Required Completion:** Screenshots, logs, queries REQUIRED
- **No Progression:** Without documented proof of functionality

### Git Workflow Integration
- **Branch Strategy:** `sprint/phase-{n}-{domain-name}` for phases, nested features
- **Commit Standards:** `feat(phase-n): description` format
- **Phase Completion:** Documentation update ‚Üí **MANDATORY TESTING** ‚Üí User approval ‚Üí Git publish
- **Emergency Protocol:** Document rollback scenarios in all commits
