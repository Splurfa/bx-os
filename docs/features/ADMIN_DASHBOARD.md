# Admin Dashboard â€“ Feature Overview

The Admin Dashboard centralizes system operations for kiosks, queues, users, and sessions.

Key sections
- Kiosk Management: Each kiosk card shows an activation toggle and the "Activated" time.
- Queue Display: Monitor and clear the queue; remove single items as needed. A confirmation dialog is shown for both Clear Queue (all) and individual removals to prevent accidental actions. Each active queue card shows a compact teacher last-name chip for context (admin view only).
- User Management: Create users, change roles, and delete users.
- Session Monitor: View active sessions by user and device (Location column removed).

Usage tips
- Use "Deactivate All" to quickly disable all kiosks.
- After toggling a kiosk, the list refreshes automatically.
- Clear Queue (all) uses a smaller button and requires confirmation.
- Role changes require admin privileges.
