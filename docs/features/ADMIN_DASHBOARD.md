# Admin Dashboard – Feature Overview

The Admin Dashboard centralizes system operations for kiosks, queues, users, and sessions.

Key sections
- Kiosk Management: Each kiosk card shows an activation toggle and the "Activated" time.
- Queue Display: Monitor and clear the queue; remove single items as needed.
- User Management: Create users, change roles, and delete users.
- Session Monitor: View active sessions by user and device (Location column removed).

Usage tips

- After toggling a kiosk, the list refreshes automatically.
- Role changes require admin privileges.
