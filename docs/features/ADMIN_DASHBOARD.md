# Admin Dashboard – Feature Overview

The Admin Dashboard centralizes system operations for kiosks, queues, users, and sessions.

Key sections
- Kiosk Management: Each kiosk card shows an activation toggle and the "Activated" time.
- Queue Display: Monitor the queue; each active item shows the teacher’s last name (last name only). Clear Queue and per-item Clear include a confirmation pop-up; individual Clear is at the far right with a red icon.
- User Management: Create users, change roles, and delete users.
- Session Monitor: View active sessions by user and device (Location column removed).

Usage tips
- Use "Deactivate All" to quickly disable all kiosks.
- After toggling a kiosk, the list refreshes automatically.
- Role changes require admin privileges.
