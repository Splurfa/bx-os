## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE & DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Device Instance Management** ‚Üí Enables secure kiosk access
2. **Authentication & Authorization** ‚Üí Enables role-based access control
3. **Session Management** ‚Üí Enables user tracking and correlation
4. **Anonymous Kiosk Access** ‚Üí Enables student workflows
5. **Data Population** ‚Üí Enables realistic testing and validation

### Feature Interdependencies
- **Device Session Management** blocks **Anonymous Kiosk Access**
- **Authentication System** blocks **User Management** and **Session Tracking**
- **UI Permission Framework** blocks **Admin Dashboard** and **User Management**
- **Student Queue Management** requires **Anonymous Kiosk Access** and **Session Management**
- **CSV Import System** requires **Authentication System** for admin access control

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
**Phase 0.5**: Complete Device Instance Management to prevent kiosk conflicts
**Phase 1-2**: Complete foundational architecture before feature implementation
**Phase 3-4**: Implement features only after stable foundation is confirmed
**Testing**: Validate each phase before proceeding to prevent cascade failures

**CRITICAL**: System requires **Device Instance Management** and **foundational architecture completion** before any feature work or data population can succeed reliably.
