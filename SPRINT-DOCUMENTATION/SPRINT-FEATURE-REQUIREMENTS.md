## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE & DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Authentication Foundation** ‚Üí All other features blocked without this
2. **Session Management** ‚Üí Required for notification system and queue management
3. **UI Permissions** ‚Üí Needed for secure feature implementation
4. **Core Features** ‚Üí Can proceed in parallel once foundation complete
5. **Data Population** ‚Üí Requires stable infrastructure for reliable import
6. **Enhancements** ‚Üí Optional improvements after core functionality validated

### Feature Interdependencies
- **Anonymous Kiosk Access** depends on **Role-Based Authentication**
- **Notification System** depends on **UI Permissions** and **Session Management**
- **Queue Management** depends on **Session Management** and **Data Flow Fixes**
- **CSV Import** depends on **All Foundational Architecture**
- **Google OAuth** depends on **Role-Based Authentication**
- **Tutorial System** depends on **All Core Features Functional**

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Phase 1 First**: Complete all foundational architecture before feature work
- **Parallel Development**: Core features can be developed simultaneously once foundation exists
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate each component before moving to dependent features
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert to current state if critical issues arise

This feature requirements document prioritizes **architectural foundation completion** to ensure reliable feature implementation and system stability.
