# üéØ CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Last Updated**: August 20, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Post-Sprint Testing - Critical Bug Resolution  
**Overall Status**: üî¥ IN TESTING - CRITICAL BUGS FOUND

---

## üîç CURRENT REALITY

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING SYSTEMS
- **Authentication & Authorization**: AdminRoute, TeacherRoute, usePermissions all functional
- **Database Infrastructure**: Supabase connection, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions operational
- **Component Framework**: UI components rendering correctly, mobile responsive
- **Google OAuth Integration**: User creation and profile assignment working
- **Basic Queue Infrastructure**: Queue display and management components exist

### üî¥ ACTIVE CRITICAL BUGS

#### Bug #1: Queue Clearing Foreign Key Constraint Error
- **Issue**: Admin "Clear Queue" function fails with foreign key constraint violation
- **Root Cause**: `behavior_history` table has dependencies that prevent deletion of `behavior_requests`
- **Impact**: Admins cannot clear queues, blocking queue management workflow
- **Status**: Needs immediate fix

#### Bug #2: Kiosk Student Assignment Detection Failure  
- **Issue**: Kiosk not detecting assigned students despite admin assignment
- **Root Cause**: Real-time synchronization issue between admin dashboard and kiosk interface
- **Impact**: Students assigned to kiosks cannot complete reflections
- **Status**: Needs immediate fix

### ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS NEEDING VERIFICATION
- End-to-end BSR workflow (blocked by bugs above)
- Real-time queue updates across multiple sessions
- Performance under concurrent usage

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Bugs (45 mins)
1. **Database Function Fix**: Update clear queue functions to handle foreign key constraints properly
2. **Real-time Sync Fix**: Resolve kiosk assignment detection and real-time updates
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete workflow after fixes

### Priority 2: Resume Testing (30 mins)
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Test queue management functionality
2. **Kiosk Interface**: Test student detection and reflection completion
3. **Real-time Validation**: Verify synchronization across interfaces
