## üèóÔ∏è NUCLEAR RESET ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

### Database Nuclear Reset Strategy
```sql
-- Complete wipe and rebuild approach
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS behavior_history CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reflections_history CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reflections CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS behavior_requests CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students CASCADE;

-- Rebuild with student-centric family architecture
CREATE TABLE families (...);  -- Family units with contact information
CREATE TABLE students (...);  -- Students linked to families
CREATE TABLE guardians (...); -- Guardian contacts with preferences
-- Plus extension tables for AI and external data
```

### CSV Import Transformation Requirements
```typescript
// Transform flat CSV into relational structure
- Extract family units from individual student records
- Create guardian relationships with communication preferences
- Establish correlation markers for external SIS integration
- Prepare extension points for AI behavioral analysis
```

### Future-Proof Extension Points
```typescript
// AI Integration Preparation
- behavior_patterns table for AI-identified trends
- ai_insights table for generated recommendations
- communication_templates for parent notification automation
- external_data table for SIS correlation framework
```
