## Implementation Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ COMPLETED & VERIFIED (Production Ready)
- **Queue Infrastructure**: QueueDisplay component functional and tested
- **Database Relationships**: Students, queue_items, BSR tables fully operational
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Supabase real-time working with live updates
- **Complete Queue Operations**: Full BSR creation → queue insertion → completion workflow
- **FK Constraint Resolution**: Queue clearing operations work without database errors (CTE solution implemented)
- **Admin Queue Management**: Clear queue functionality operational with proper transaction handling

### ✅ INTEGRATION TESTED (End-to-End Validated)  
- **Student Data Mapping**: Proper field references confirmed and working
- **Queue Status Updates**: Real-time status changes functional across all interfaces
- **Kiosk Assignment**: Auto-assignment logic implemented and tested
- **Queue Position Management**: Position calculation and progression working

### ✅ PRODUCTION FEATURES (Ready for Deployment)
- **Automatic Kiosk Assignment**: Students auto-assigned to available kiosks
- **Queue Position Calculation**: Auto-increment positions with conflict prevention
- **Auto-progression**: Next student assignment after BSR completion functional
- **Student Name Display**: Proper first_name/last_name display confirmed working
- **Queue Clearing**: Admin can clear queue with proper foreign key constraint handling

## Queue Status Definitions (VALIDATED)

### ✅ VERIFIED QUEUE ITEM STATES
- **pending**: Student created, waiting for kiosk assignment  
- **assigned**: Student assigned to specific kiosk, in progress
- **completed**: Student finished BSR, ready for teacher review
- **reviewed**: Teacher reviewed and approved/returned BSR

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED ASSIGNMENT LOGIC
- **First Available**: Assign to first free kiosk (1, then 2, then 3)
- **Conflict Prevention**: Only one student per kiosk at a time
- **Auto-progression**: Automatically assign next student when kiosk becomes free

## Foreign Key Constraint Resolution (IMPLEMENTED)

### ✅ QUEUE CLEARING SOLUTION
- **CTE Transactions**: Common Table Expressions properly handle dependent records
- **Order of Operations**: Delete reflections before queue_items before behavior_requests
- **Error Prevention**: No more foreign key constraint violations during queue clearing
- **Admin Functionality**: Queue clearing button works reliably in production
