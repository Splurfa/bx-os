# BX-OS FLOWCHART ARCHITECTURE

This directory implements the BX-OS Flowchart Protocol Standards for comprehensive system documentation.

## Flowchart Categories

### Current-State Analysis (01-04)
Documents verified, functional system capabilities with problem identification
- `01-current-authentication-routing.md` - Validated auth flow (âœ… FUNCTIONAL)
- `02-current-kiosk-logic.md` - Kiosk system analysis  
- `03-current-database-schema.md` - Database structure validation
- `04-current-session-management.md` - Session tracking assessment

### Sprint-02-Targets (05-08) 
Defines implementable targets based on validated capabilities
- `05-updated-authentication.md` - Auth system refinements
- `06-simplified-kiosk-system.md` - Kiosk deployment architecture
- `07-updated-queue-management.md` - Queue system implementation
- `08-middle-school-filtering.md` - Student filtering requirements

### Future-Vision (09-12+)
Long-term scalability and integration architecture
- `09-scalable-single-school-architecture.md` - Expansion planning
- `10-behavior-analytics-enhancement.md` - Analytics integration
- `11-system-integration-architecture.md` - Platform integration

### User-Journeys (11+)
Complete stakeholder experience flows
- `11-complete-student-journey.md` - End-to-end student workflow
- `12-teacher-workflow-journey.md` - Teacher dashboard experience  
- `13-admin-oversight-journey.md` - Administrative oversight flow

## Protocol Standards
- Color Coding: Red (problems), Green (targets), Purple (future), Blue (journeys)
- Cross-Referencing: All flowcharts reference implementation status
- Validation Integration: Claims backed by functional testing evidence
