# 🔬 Sprint Self-Validation Framework

## 🎯 VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle**: Claims must be backed by functional testing, not documentation assumptions.

Every implementation phase requires three levels of validation:
1. **Component-Level**: Individual parts work in isolation
2. **Integration-Level**: Parts work together correctly  
3. **System-Level**: Complete user workflows function end-to-end

## 🧪 PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION

### System State Reality Check
Before starting ANY sprint work:

#### Database Connectivity & Schema Validation
```sql
-- REQUIRED: Verify database is operational and matches schema expectations
SELECT 
  table_name, 
  column_name, 
  data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Verify key tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM queue; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM active_sessions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM behavior_incidents;
```

#### Authentication System Health Check
```typescript
// Test current auth state
const { user, session } = useAuth();
console.log('Auth Status:', { user: !!user, session: !!session });

// Verify protected routes
// Navigate to /admin, /teacher, /kiosk routes and document actual behavior
```

#### Component Existence Verification  
```bash
# Verify claimed components actually exist
ls src/components/AdminRoute.tsx      # Should exist if claimed
ls src/components/TeacherRoute.tsx    # Should exist if claimed  
ls src/hooks/usePermissions.ts        # Should exist if claimed
ls src/lib/permissions.ts             # Should exist if claimed
```

#### UI Component Functionality Test
```javascript  
// Test critical interactive components
// NotificationBell: Does dropdown open/close?
// QueueDisplay: Does it show real data?
// UserManagement: Are functions restricted by role?
```

## 🔄 MID-SPRINT VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

### Implementation Status Reality Check

#### Checkpoint 1: Authentication Foundation (After Phase 1)
```markdown
**Required Validations:**
- [ ] Can admin user access /admin dashboard?
- [ ] Is teacher user blocked from /admin dashboard? 
- [ ] Can anonymous user access /kiosk1 without authentication?
- [ ] Does Google OAuth create user profile with correct role?
- [ ] Are sessions tracked with correct user information?

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Test with actual admin Google account
2. Test with actual teacher Google account  
3. Test anonymous kiosk access in incognito mode
4. Verify session data shows correct user names (not "Unknown User")
```

#### Checkpoint 2: UI Permission Framework (After Component Updates)
```markdown
**Required Validations:**
- [ ] Does NotificationBell dropdown respond to clicks?
- [ ] Are admin-only functions hidden from teacher users?
- [ ] Does student lookup use correct field names (first_name, last_name)?
- [ ] Does queue display show all student statuses correctly?

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Login as different role types and verify UI behavior
2. Test component interactions in actual browser environment
3. Verify data displays match database content
4. Check console for JavaScript errors during interactions
```

#### Checkpoint 3: Data Flow Validation (After Integration)
```markdown
**Required Validations:**  
- [ ] Student CSV import creates correct database records
- [ ] Queue operations (add/update/remove) work end-to-end
- [ ] Real-time updates sync across multiple browser windows
- [ ] BSR creation workflow completes successfully

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Import actual student data via CSV
2. Test queue operations from kiosk and admin views
3. Open multiple browser windows and verify real-time sync
4. Complete full BSR workflow from creation to resolution
```

## 🎯 END-TO-END WORKFLOW VALIDATION

### Critical User Journey Testing

#### Anonymous Student Kiosk Workflow
```markdown
**Test Scenario**: Student using kiosk without authentication
1. Navigate to /kiosk1 in incognito mode
2. Should NOT be redirected to authentication  
3. Should be able to select name from student list
4. Should be able to complete behavior selection
5. Should create queue entry with correct student information

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] No authentication barriers
- [ ] Student selection works correctly
- [ ] Queue entry created with proper data correlation
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
```

#### Teacher Dashboard Workflow  
```markdown
**Test Scenario**: Teacher managing student queue and creating BSRs
1. Login with teacher Google account
2. Navigate to /teacher (should succeed)
3. Navigate to /admin (should be blocked)  
4. View student queue with real-time updates
5. Create BSR for student in queue
6. Complete BSR workflow to resolution

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Teacher can access appropriate dashboards only
- [ ] Queue displays correct student information  
- [ ] BSR creation and completion workflow functional
- [ ] Real-time updates work across sessions
```

#### Admin System Management Workflow
```markdown
**Test Scenario**: Admin user managing system and users
1. Login with admin Google account  
2. Access all dashboard areas (admin, teacher views)
3. Import student data via CSV
4. Manage user accounts and role assignments
5. Monitor system activity and session tracking

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Admin has access to all system areas
- [ ] CSV import creates correct database structure
- [ ] User management functions work correctly
- [ ] Session monitoring shows accurate information
```

## 🔍 COMPONENT-LEVEL VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

### Authentication Components
```typescript
// AdminRoute Component Validation
const AdminRouteTest = () => {
  // Test 1: Admin user should see protected content
  // Test 2: Non-admin user should be redirected or blocked
  // Test 3: Unauthenticated user should be handled appropriately
};

// TeacherRoute Component Validation  
const TeacherRouteTest = () => {
  // Test 1: Teacher user should see protected content
  // Test 2: Non-teacher user should be redirected or blocked
  // Test 3: Authentication state changes handled correctly
};
```

### Permission System Validation
```typescript  
// usePermissions Hook Validation
const PermissionsTest = () => {
  const { canAccess, hasRole } = usePermissions();
  
  // Test admin permissions
  console.log('Admin can manage users:', canAccess('user-management'));
  console.log('Has admin role:', hasRole('admin'));
  
  // Test teacher permissions  
  console.log('Teacher can create BSR:', canAccess('bsr-creation'));
  console.log('Has teacher role:', hasRole('teacher'));
};
```

### UI Component Integration Validation
```typescript
// NotificationBell Component Validation

  // Test 2: Displays actual notification data
  // Test 3: Handles empty notification state
  // Test 4: Click outside closes dropdown

## 📊 INTEGRATION VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

### Database Integration Testing
```sql
-- Test data integrity across related tables
SELECT 
  s.first_name,
  s.last_name, 
  q.status,
  q.created_at
FROM students s
JOIN queue q ON s.id = q.student_id  
WHERE q.status = 'waiting'
ORDER BY q.created_at;

-- Test session correlation
SELECT 
  p.display_name,
  s.device_type,
  s.created_at
FROM profiles p
JOIN active_sessions s ON p.user_id = s.user_id
WHERE s.is_active = true;
```

### Real-Time Subscription Testing
```typescript
// Test Supabase real-time functionality
const testRealtimeUpdates = () => {
  // Subscribe to queue changes
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('queue-changes')
    .on('postgres_changes', 
        { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'queue' },
        (payload) => console.log('Queue update:', payload)
    )
    .subscribe();
    
  // Test: Make change in one browser window, verify update in another
};
```

### Authentication Integration Testing
```typescript
// Test Google OAuth integration and profile creation
const testAuthFlow = async () => {
  // Test login
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'google'
  });
  
  // Verify profile creation
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', data.user?.id);
    
  console.log('Profile created:', profile);
};
```
