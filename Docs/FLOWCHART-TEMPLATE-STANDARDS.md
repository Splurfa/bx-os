2. **AI/ML Integration**: Pattern recognition and predictive analytics

## Implementation Pathway
1. **Phase 1 Foundation**: Current sprint deliverables as building blocks
2. **Phase 2 Enhancement**: Intermediate improvements building toward vision
3. **Phase 3 Vision**: Full future-state implementation

## Architectural Principles
- **Security-First**: Privacy and compliance requirements
- **Scalability**: Multi-school and high-load considerations  
- **Integration-Ready**: Standards-based external system connectivity
- **User-Centric**: Experience-driven design and functionality
```

### Content Requirements
