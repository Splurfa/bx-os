# üóëÔ∏è TRASH-REPO-CONTENTS

This folder contains all previous sprint materials that did not follow proper protocol structure.

**Contents moved from**: SPRINT-01-LAUNCH (non-compliant structure)
**Date moved**: 2025-08-19
**Reason**: Repository reorganization to follow SPRINT-WORKFLOW-FRAMEWORK protocols

These materials may contain valuable content but were organized incorrectly. They have been preserved here for reference while building protocol-compliant sprint structure.

## Protocol Violations in Original Structure
- Mixed preparation and execution documents in main sprint folder
- Non-standard naming conventions
- Missing required flowchart architecture
- Incomplete cross-reference integration
- Documentation not aligned with actual system state

## New Protocol-Compliant Structure
See `SPRINT-02-LAUNCH/` for properly organized sprint following:
- `Docs/AI-ASSISTANT-SPRINT-PROTOCOL.md`
- `Docs/SPRINT-WORKFLOW-FRAMEWORK.md` 
- `Docs/SPRINT-VALIDATION-FRAMEWORK.md`
