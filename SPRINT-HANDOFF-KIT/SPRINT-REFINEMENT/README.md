# Sprint Refinement Subfolder

## Purpose

This subfolder contains the **refined source-of-truth materials** produced by the Sprint Workflow Framework execution on August 18, 2025. These documents represent the corrected understanding of the BX-OS system state after comprehensive diagnostic analysis revealed critical architectural failures.

## Contents

### Phase Artifacts (Sequential Analysis)
- **PHASE-1-DIAGNOSTIC-SUMMARY.md**: System analysis revealing critical architectural failures
- **PHASE-2-DOCUMENT-SCORING.md**: Evaluation of existing sprint documentation accuracy
- **PHASE-2.5-INTENT-SYNTHESIS.md**: Clarified sprint intent based on actual vs documented requirements
- **PHASE-3-ALIGNMENT-MAPPING.md**: Gap analysis between current state and documented claims
- **PHASE-4-SPRINT-PLAN.md**: Action plan for addressing architectural foundation gaps

### Framework Process
- **SPRINT-WORKFLOW-FRAMEWORK.md**: The systematic framework protocol for sprint analysis and refinement

## Key Findings Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The system has fundamental architectural gaps despite documentation claiming "100% Complete" status:

- ❌ **Authentication Crisis**: No role-based route protection
- ❌ **Session Management Broken**: "Unknown User" issues and role correlation failures  
- ❌ **UI Permission System Missing**: Admin functions exposed to all users
- ❌ **Core Workflows Blocked**: Students cannot access kiosk routes
- ❌ **NotificationBell Broken**: Component exists but interactions fail

## Action Required

The sprint plan in **PHASE-4-SPRINT-PLAN.md** provides a systematic approach to:
1. Build missing authentication/authorization architecture
2. Fix session management and UI permission systems
3. Restore core functionality and data flow
4. Correct misleading documentation

## Status

**Sprint requires architectural foundation completion** before any feature implementation or data population can succeed on stable infrastructure.
