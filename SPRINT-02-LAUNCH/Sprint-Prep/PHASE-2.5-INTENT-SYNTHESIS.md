# Phase 2.5: Intent Synthesis - SPRINT-02-LAUNCH (VALIDATED)

## 🎯 CLARIFIED PROJECT INTENT & REQUIREMENTS

### Core Intent Validation
**VALIDATED REQUIREMENT**: Deploy functional behavior support request system for **159 middle school students (grades 6-8)** using **3 dedicated iPads** in single school environment.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: System architecture already substantially complete and functional. Sprint focus shifts from "building missing components" to "completing minor gaps and deployment preparation."

## 📋 SYNTHESIZED REQUIREMENTS (Evidence-Based)

### Primary Stakeholder Needs (Validated)

#### School Administration  
- **Need**: Monitor and manage student behavior support requests
- **Current State**: ✅ FUNCTIONAL - AdminRoute working, user management operational  
- **Gap**: Minor - Need session tracking if desired for oversight
- **Priority**: LOW - Core functionality exists

#### Teachers
- **Need**: Create BSRs, monitor queue, access student selection  
- **Current State**: ✅ FUNCTIONAL - TeacherRoute working, authentication operational
- **Gap**: Minor - Need student data filtering by grade level
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Requires database schema completion  

#### Students (Grades 6-8)
- **Need**: Anonymous access to kiosk workflow on assigned iPad
- **Current State**: ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE READY - Kiosk components exist, routing operational
- **Gap**: Minor - Need queue-based assignment and grade filtering
- **Priority**: HIGH - Requires student data population

## 🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (Realistic Scope)

### Database Schema Completion
```sql
-- REQUIRED: Add student filtering capabilities
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN grade_level TEXT CHECK (grade_level IN ('6','7','8'));
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- OPTIONAL: Session tracking for admin monitoring  
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS active_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  kiosk_id TEXT,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

### Data Population Requirements
- **Student Import**: CSV processing for 159 middle school students
- **Grade Validation**: Ensure only 6th-8th grade students included
- **Data Quality**: Verify student names, IDs, and metadata accuracy

### Deployment Configuration  
- **Kiosk URLs**: Static routing to `/kiosk1`, `/kiosk2`, `/kiosk3`
- **Anonymous Access**: Ensure kiosk routes bypass authentication
- **Queue Management**: Validate admin functions for queue monitoring/clearing

## 🎯 SYNTHESIZED SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Functional Requirements (Must Work)
1. **Teacher Workflow**: Create BSR → Select student → Student appears in queue
2. **Student Workflow**: Access kiosk → Complete assigned BSR → Auto-progress to next
3. **Admin Oversight**: Monitor all queues → Clear queues when needed → View session data

### Performance Requirements (Realistic Targets)  
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 2-3 teachers + 3 kiosk sessions simultaneously
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for queue updates and kiosk assignment
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime during school hours (8 AM - 3 PM)

### Security Requirements (Appropriate Level)
- **Admin Access**: Role-based dashboard protection (already functional)
- **Student Privacy**: Anonymous kiosk access without data exposure  
- **Data Integrity**: BSR data properly associated with correct students

## 📊 SCOPE CLARIFICATION (Right-Sized)

### In Scope for Sprint 02
- ✅ **Database Schema Completion**: Add missing student filtering columns
- ✅ **Student Data Population**: Import 159 middle school students  
- ✅ **Queue Testing**: Validate end-to-end BSR workflow
- ✅ **Kiosk Assignment**: Ensure anonymous access and queue-based assignment

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- ❌ **Multi-School Support**: Single school deployment only
- ❌ **Complex Device Management**: Static iPad assignment sufficient  
- ❌ **Advanced Analytics**: Basic queue monitoring sufficient for MVP
- ❌ **Integration APIs**: Standalone system appropriate for initial deployment

### Scope Boundary Validation
**ORIGINAL ASSUMPTION**: Complex multi-school platform requiring extensive architecture
**VALIDATED REALITY**: Single-school system with most components already functional
**IMPACT**: 75% scope reduction allows focus on quality and deployment readiness

## 🔄 REQUIREMENT ALIGNMENT MATRIX

### Stakeholder vs Technical Alignment

| Stakeholder Need | Technical Reality | Gap Analysis | Priority |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------|  
| Teacher BSR Creation | ✅ Components exist | Minor UI testing | LOW |
| Student Selection | ⚠️ Missing filtering | Database columns | HIGH |
| Kiosk Access | ✅ Routes exist | Queue assignment | MEDIUM |
| Admin Monitoring | ✅ Role protection works | Session tracking | LOW |
| Queue Management | ✅ Infrastructure ready | End-to-end testing | MEDIUM |

## 🎯 VALIDATED SPRINT OBJECTIVES  

### Primary Objectives (Must Complete)
1. **Database Schema**: Complete student filtering capabilities
2. **Data Population**: Import and validate middle school student data
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete BSR workflow functionality  
4. **Anonymous Access**: Confirm kiosk routes work without authentication barriers

### Secondary Objectives (Should Complete)  
1. **Performance Validation**: Test concurrent access scenarios
2. **Admin Functions**: Validate queue management and monitoring tools
3. **User Experience**: Ensure smooth workflow transitions and feedback
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment guide with actual system state

### Success Metrics (Measurable)
- **Functional**: 100% of core workflows complete successfully
- **Performance**: < 2 second response times under normal load
- **Reliability**: Zero critical errors during 4-hour continuous testing
- **User Experience**: Teachers can create BSRs and students can complete them without assistance

---

**SYNTHESIS CONCLUSION**: Project intent well-aligned with technical capabilities. System substantially complete with minor gaps requiring straightforward implementation. High confidence in sprint success due to realistic scope and functional foundation.
