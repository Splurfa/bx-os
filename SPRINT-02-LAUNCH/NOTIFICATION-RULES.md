## üéØ NOTIFICATION DISPLAY RULES

### What Makes a Good Notification
1. **Clear Action Required**: "Review needed" vs "For your info"
2. **Student Name Prominent**: Easy to identify which student
3. **Kiosk Location**: When relevant, show which kiosk
4. **Time Sensitivity**: How urgent is this action
5. **One-Click Action**: Link directly to review screen when possible

### What We DON'T Want
1. **Spam**: Too many low-priority notifications
2. **Irrelevant Info**: Notifications about other teachers' students
3. **Unclear Actions**: Vague messages that don't explain what to do
4. **System Noise**: Technical details that don't help users
