**Success Criteria:**
- All three kiosks (/kiosk1, /kiosk2, /kiosk3) functional
- Independent student workflows on each kiosk
- Admin dashboard shows all kiosk status correctly
- No conflicts between kiosk operations

#### 2.2 Production Data Population (45 minutes)
**Tasks:**

- Verify family/guardian data integrity

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete student roster loaded (target: 159 middle school students)
- Grade-level filtering working with full dataset
- Performance acceptable for student selection
- Family relationships properly maintained

#### 2.3 Performance Optimization (30 minutes)
**Tasks:**
- Test system performance with realistic data volume
- Optimize database queries for production scale
- Verify real-time subscriptions scale appropriately
- Test memory usage and loading times

**Success Criteria:**
- Page load times under 3 seconds for all dashboards
- Real-time updates responsive with full dataset
- Memory usage stable during extended sessions
- Database queries optimized for production scale

#### 2.4 Environment Configuration (15 minutes)
**Tasks:**
- Verify production environment settings
- Configure monitoring and error tracking
- Set up backup and recovery procedures
- Document system requirements and dependencies

**Success Criteria:**
- Production environment properly configured
- Monitoring systems operational
- Backup procedures documented and tested
- System requirements clearly documented

## üéØ PHASE 3: DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION (1 hour)

### Objective: Finalize System for Live Deployment

#### 3.1 Deployment Documentation (20 minutes)
**Tasks:**
