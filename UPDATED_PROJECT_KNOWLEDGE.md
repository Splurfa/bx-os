## Core Features and Workflows

### 1. Behavior Request Management

**Teacher Workflow:**
1. **Request Creation**: Teachers create Behavior Support Requests (BSRs) through an intuitive form
   - Student selection with search functionality
   - Mood selection (happy, sad, angry, frustrated, anxious, calm, excited)
   - Behavior categorization (disruption, defiance, inappropriate language, etc.)
   - Urgency flag for priority handling
   - Optional notes for context

2. **Queue Monitoring**: Real-time view of active requests
   - Live updates as students move through the system
   - Time elapsed tracking for each request
   - Status indicators (waiting, in progress, completed)

3. **Reflection Review**: Teachers review and approve student reflections
   - Read student responses to reflection questions
   - Provide feedback for revisions if needed
   - Approve completed reflections for student return to class

### 2. Student Reflection System

**Multi-Kiosk Support**: Three dedicated kiosk interfaces (expandable)

**Kiosk Workflow:**
1. **Welcome Screen**: Personalized greeting for assigned student
2. **Password Authentication**: Student password verification for security
3. **Reflection Process**: Four-question guided reflection:
   - "What did you do that led to being sent out of class?"
   - "What were you hoping would happen when you acted that way?"
   - "Who else was impacted by your behavior, and in what way?"
   - "Write two sentences showing you understand what's expected when you return to class."
4. **Completion**: Automatic submission and teacher notification

**Key Features:**
- Auto-activation and session management
- Progress tracking through reflection steps
- Teacher feedback integration for revision requests
- Automatic queue progression

### 3. Administrative Dashboard

**Unified Control Center:**
- **Kiosk Management**: Activate/deactivate kiosks, monitor usage
- **Queue Overview**: Real-time view of all behavior requests
- **Session Monitoring**: Track active user sessions across the system
- **User Management**: Manage teacher and admin accounts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Historical data and behavior trends

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Live kiosk status updates
- Queue position tracking
- Session activity monitoring
- System health indicators

### 4. Behavior History System

**Comprehensive Data Archival:**
- Complete intervention records preserved automatically
- Student behavior pattern tracking
- Teacher workload analytics
- System usage statistics
- Outcome tracking (approved, revision requested, incomplete)

**Data Points Captured:**
- Student and teacher information
- Behavior categories and mood states
- Time metrics (queue time, reflection duration)
- Kiosk and device information
- Reflection content and feedback
- Final intervention outcomes

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

**students**: Student records with grade and class information
**profiles**: User profiles linked to Supabase Auth (teachers, admins)
**behavior_requests**: Active queue of behavior support requests
**reflections**: Student reflection responses and teacher feedback
**kiosks**: Physical kiosk station management
**behavior_history**: Complete archive of all interventions
**user_sessions**: Session tracking for monitoring and analytics

### Relationships

- Students can have multiple behavior requests
- Each request can have one reflection
