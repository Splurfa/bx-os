# üîç Sprint Preparation Phase - SPRINT-02-LAUNCH

This folder contains all diagnostic, analysis, and planning work completed during the preparation phase of Sprint 02.

## üìã Preparation Sequence

### Phase 1: System Diagnostics
**PHASE-1-DIAGNOSTIC-SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive analysis of current system state, identifying architectural gaps and simplification opportunities.

### Phase 2: Documentation Audit  
**PHASE-2-DOCUMENT-SCORING.md** - Scoring and validation of existing documentation accuracy, identifying misalignment between documented and actual system capabilities.

### Phase 2.5: Requirements Synthesis
**PHASE-2.5-INTENT-SYNTHESIS.md** - Synthesis of stakeholder requirements into simplified, achievable architecture focused on core functionality.

### Phase 3: Technical Alignment
**PHASE-3-ALIGNMENT-MAPPING.md** - Mapping of technical dependencies and implementation sequence for simplified kiosk system.

### Phase 4: Sprint Planning
**PHASE-4-SPRINT-PLAN.md** - Final execution plan with phases, timelines, and validation checkpoints for implementation.

## üéØ Preparation Outcomes

The preparation phase revealed the need for architectural simplification based on actual requirements:

- **Target Audience**: 159 middle school students (6th-8th grade only)
- **Hardware Context**: 3 dedicated iPads for consistent, reliable access
- **Access Pattern**: Static URLs for simple tech team management
- **Geographic Scope**: Single school deployment, not multi-school platform

## üìä Analysis Summary

**System Health**: Core functionality exists but over-engineered for actual requirements  
**Documentation Accuracy**: Previous complexity assumptions not aligned with actual needs  
**Implementation Priority**: Simplification and reliability over advanced features  
**Risk Assessment**: Low - simplifying rather than building complex new systems

## üéØ Sprint Focus Areas

### Primary Objectives
1. **Security & Grade Filtering**: Ensure only middle school students can access system
2. **Simplified Kiosk Architecture**: Replace complex device management with static URLs
3. **Queue Management Reliability**: Fix core queue operations and real-time updates
4. **Data Integration Readiness**: Prepare clean foundation for school system integration

### Success Criteria
- 3 static kiosk URLs functional (`/kiosk/1`, `/kiosk/2`, `/kiosk/3`)
- Reliable anonymous access for student workflow
- Proper role-based restrictions for admin/teacher functions
- Clean, maintainable codebase ready for data integration

This preparation work established the simplification-first approach required for reliable, maintainable system deployment.
