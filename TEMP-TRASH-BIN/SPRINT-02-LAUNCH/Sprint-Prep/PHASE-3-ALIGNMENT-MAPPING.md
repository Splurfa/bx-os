# Phase 3: Technical Alignment Mapping - SPRINT-02-LAUNCH

## 🗺️ TECHNICAL DEPENDENCY ARCHITECTURE

### Implementation Sequence Requirements

**FOUNDATION-FIRST APPROACH:** Changes must be implemented in specific order to maintain system integrity during simplification process.

## 📋 PHASE-BY-PHASE DEPENDENCY MAPPING

### Phase 1: Security & Grade Filtering (Prerequisites: None)
```
Database Policy Updates
├── Update RLS policies for anonymous kiosk access
├── Implement grade-level filtering (6th-8th only)
└── Validate policy effectiveness

Route Protection Validation  
├── Test AdminRoute component functionality
├── Test TeacherRoute component functionality  
└── Verify anonymous access to kiosk routes

Authentication Integration Testing
├── Google OAuth flow validation
├── Role assignment verification
└── Session management correlation
```

**Dependencies:** Independent phase - can begin immediately  
**Validation Required:** Authentication boundaries work correctly before proceeding

### Phase 2: Kiosk Simplification (Prerequisites: Phase 1 Complete)
```
Static URL Implementation
├── Update route configuration for /kiosk/1, /kiosk/2, /kiosk/3
├── Remove dynamic device assignment logic
└── Update kiosk component routing

Device Management Cleanup
├── Remove device fingerprinting code
├── Eliminate complex session correlation
└── Clean up unused device detection components

Admin Dashboard Updates
├── Display static URLs for tech team
├── Remove dynamic device management UI
└── Update system configuration interface
```

**Dependencies:** Authentication system must be stable from Phase 1  
**Risk Mitigation:** Test static routing before removing dynamic components

### Phase 3: Queue Management Fixes (Prerequisites: Phase 2 Complete)
```
Admin Function Debugging
├── Debug admin_clear_all_queues() function
├── Test queue clearing with history preservation
└── Validate admin queue management functions

Student Data Mapping
├── Fix student lookup field references
├── Validate first_name/last_name usage
└── Test student selection workflow

Real-time Update Validation
├── Test queue updates across interfaces
├── Validate Supabase subscription functionality
└── Confirm multi-session synchronization
```

**Dependencies:** Simplified routing must be stable from Phase 2  
**Integration Points:** Queue functionality depends on student data integrity

### Phase 4: Data Integration Preparation (Prerequisites: Phase 3 Complete)
```
Student Data Filtering
├── Filter dataset to middle school only (6th-8th grade)
├── Validate student record completeness
└── Test filtered data in kiosk selection

Schema Validation
├── Confirm database schema ready for integration
├── Test foreign key relationships
└── Validate data integrity constraints

Integration Point Documentation
├── Document data import requirements
├── Map integration touchpoints
└── Prepare for school system data enrichment
```

**Dependencies:** All core functionality must be stable before data preparation  
**Future Integration:** Sets foundation for external system connections

## 🔗 COMPONENT INTEGRATION MATRIX

### Critical Component Relationships

#### Authentication Flow Dependencies
```
Google OAuth → Profile Creation → Role Assignment → Route Protection
     ↓              ↓                 ↓               ↓
   Session      User Record      Permission      Protected Access
  Tracking      Management        System          Validation
```

#### Kiosk Workflow Dependencies  
```
Static URL → Anonymous Access → Student Selection → Queue Entry
     ↓             ↓                   ↓              ↓
   Routing      No Auth          Grade Filter    Real-time
  Config       Barriers         (6th-8th)        Updates
```

#### Queue Management Dependencies
```
Student Data → Queue Operations → Real-time Updates → Admin Functions
     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓
   Field          CRUD              Supabase         Clear/Manage
  Mapping        Operations        Subscriptions      Functions
```

## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### High-Risk Integration Points

#### Authentication/Authorization Boundary
**Risk:** Simplifying authentication might break admin/teacher protection  
**Mitigation:** Test role-based access thoroughly after each phase  
**Validation:** Attempt unauthorized access to protected routes

#### Real-time Queue Updates
**Risk:** Queue synchronization might break during simplification  
**Mitigation:** Test multi-session updates after routing changes  
**Validation:** Open multiple browser windows, verify live updates

#### Student Data Integrity
**Risk:** Student filtering might corrupt existing data relationships  
**Mitigation:** Backup data before filtering, test referential integrity  
**Validation:** Verify BSR workflow maintains data correlation

### Medium-Risk Dependencies

#### Static URL Routing
**Risk:** Route changes might break existing bookmarks or integrations  
**Mitigation:** Implement redirects from old routes if they exist  
**Validation:** Test direct navigation to all kiosk URLs

#### Device Session Cleanup
**Risk:** Removing session tracking might affect analytics or audit trails  
**Mitigation:** Preserve essential session data, document what's removed  
**Validation:** Verify admin dashboard shows appropriate session information

## 🔧 TECHNICAL CONSTRAINT MAPPING
