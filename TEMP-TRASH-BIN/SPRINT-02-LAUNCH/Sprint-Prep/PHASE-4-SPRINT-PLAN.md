- [ ] RLS policies tested and validated

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Anonymous user can access `/kiosk/1`, `/kiosk/2`, `/kiosk/3`
- Only middle school students appear in kiosk selection
- Admin/teacher routes remain protected

#### Hour 2: Authentication Boundary Testing

- [ ] Authentication integration tested with actual accounts
- [ ] Session management validated with correct user correlation

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Admin user can access admin dashboard, teacher cannot
- Teacher user can access teacher dashboard, no admin functions
- Google OAuth creates profiles with correct role assignments

### Phase 2: Kiosk System Simplification (2 hours)

#### Hour 3: Static URL Implementation  
**Tasks:**
- Update React Router configuration for static kiosk URLs
- Remove dynamic device assignment and routing logic
- Test static URL access from multiple devices

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Static URLs `/kiosk/1`, `/kiosk/2`, `/kiosk/3` functional
- [ ] Dynamic device management code removed
- [ ] Routing simplified and tested

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Direct navigation to each kiosk URL works correctly
- Kiosk functionality identical to previous dynamic version
- No routing errors or broken component references

#### Hour 4: Device Management Cleanup
**Tasks:**
- Remove device fingerprinting and session correlation code
- Update admin dashboard to display static URLs
- Clean up unused device detection components

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Device fingerprinting code removed
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows static URLs for tech team
- [ ] Unused components cleaned from codebase

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Admin dashboard provides clear setup instructions for iPads
- System performance improved from reduced complexity
- No broken references to removed device management functions

### Phase 3: Queue Management Fixes (1 hour)

#### Hour 5: Queue Function Debugging & Testing
**Tasks:**  
- Debug `admin_clear_all_queues()` function if issues exist
- Fix student lookup field references (first_name/last_name)
- Test real-time queue updates across multiple browser sessions

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Admin queue clearing functions work reliably
- [ ] Student data mapping uses correct field references
- [ ] Real-time updates sync across teacher/admin interfaces

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Queue clearing preserves BSR history appropriately
- Student names display correctly in all interfaces
- Multiple admin/teacher sessions see live queue updates

### Phase 4: Data Integration Preparation (1 hour)

#### Hour 6: Data Filtering & Integration Readiness
**Tasks:**
- Filter student dataset to middle school only (validate 159 count)
- Validate database schema for future school system integration
- Test complete workflow: student reflection ‚Üí teacher notification

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Student data filtered and validated (159 middle school students)
- [ ] Database schema confirmed ready for integration
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tested and documented

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Student count matches expected 159 middle school students
- Complete kiosk-to-teacher workflow functions correctly
- Integration points documented for future school system connections

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable modifications with validation at each step
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Reality Testing**: Validate each change with actual usage scenarios
4. **Simplicity Focus**: Remove complexity rather than adding new features

### Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Component Testing**: Each modified component tested individually
- **Integration Testing**: Changed components tested together
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows validated
- **Performance Testing**: System responsiveness confirmed under load

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION PLAN

### Critical Risk Factors

#### Authentication Boundary Changes (Medium Risk)
**Risk**: Simplifying authentication might break role-based protection  
**Mitigation**: Test admin/teacher access thoroughly after each auth change  
**Rollback Plan**: Revert authentication policies if role protection fails

#### Real-time Update Integrity (Medium Risk)  
**Risk**: Queue updates might break during routing simplification  
**Mitigation**: Test multi-session updates after each routing change  
**Rollback Plan**: Restore dynamic routing if real-time features fail

#### Data Filtering Impact (Low Risk)
**Risk**: Student filtering might affect existing BSR workflows  
**Mitigation**: Test complete student-to-teacher workflow after filtering  
**Rollback Plan**: Remove filters if workflow integrity compromised

### Contingency Plans

#### If Phase 1 Fails (Authentication Issues)
- Revert RLS policy changes
- Debug authentication integration before proceeding
- Extend timeline if authentication debugging requires more than 2 hours

#### If Phase 2 Fails (Routing Issues)
- Restore dynamic routing components temporarily
- Debug static URL implementation
- Consider hybrid approach with static URLs but preserved dynamic backend

#### If Phase 3 Fails (Queue Management Issues)
- Focus on critical queue operations only
- Document known issues for future sprint resolution
- Ensure basic student workflow remains functional
