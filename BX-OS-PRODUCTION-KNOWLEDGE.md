### Post-Sprint Evolution Roadmap
**Phase 2: AI Integration** (Weeks 2-4)
- Behavioral pattern recognition using imported reflection data
- AI-generated intervention suggestions based on family context and behavioral history
- External SIS data correlation using time/name/grade matching algorithms

**Phase 3: Communication Platform** (Months 2-3)
- Automated parent notifications using guardian contact preferences
- Template-based communication workflows for behavioral events
- Multi-channel support (email, SMS, app notifications) with engagement tracking

**Phase 4: Multi-School Intelligence** (Months 4-6)
- Cross-school behavioral trend analysis and best practice sharing
- District-level administrative dashboards with compliance monitoring
- Resource sharing and intervention strategy collaboration between schools

## üóÇÔ∏è DATA ARCHITECTURE

### Nuclear Reset Database Schema (Future-Proof Foundation)

#### **Core Student Data (Family-Centric Model)**
1. **families** - Family units with primary contact information and addresses
2. **students** - Student records linked to families with external correlation markers
3. **guardians** - Guardian/parent contacts with communication preferences and relationships
4. **behavior_requests** - Teacher-initiated BSR records with family context
5. **reflections** - Student 4-question responses with AI analysis hooks
6. **behavior_history** - Completed workflow records with intervention tracking

#### **Extension Point Tables (Prepared for Future Features)**
7. **external_data** - SIS correlation data for academic/attendance integration
8. **data_sources** - External system connection tracking (PowerSchool, Infinite Campus, etc.)
9. **behavior_patterns** - AI-identified behavioral trends and recurring issues
10. **ai_insights** - Generated recommendations and early warning alerts
11. **communication_templates** - Parent notification templates and workflows
12. **communication_logs** - Message delivery tracking and engagement metrics

#### **System Management (Enhanced)**
13. **profiles** - User account management with super_admin role support
14. **kiosks** - Physical device management with location tracking
15. **user_sessions** - Session tracking with device identification

### Enhanced BSR Workflow with Family Context
```
Teacher Creates BSR (with family context) ‚Üí Student Assigned to Kiosk ‚Üí 
Reflection Questions (with AI pattern detection) ‚Üí Teacher Review (with AI insights) ‚Üí 
Resolution (with family notification) ‚Üí Pattern Analysis (for future interventions)
```

**State Transitions:**
- `waiting` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed` ‚Üí `archived` ‚Üí `analyzed`
- Family notification triggers and communication workflow automation
- AI pattern detection and intervention recommendation generation
- External data correlation for comprehensive student support
