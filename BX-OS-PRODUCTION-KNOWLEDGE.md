# üéØ BX-OS Production Knowledge

**MISSION:** Transform Student Behavior Management System into a comprehensive **Behavioral Intelligence Platform** through nuclear database reset and strategic architecture rebuild within 24-hour sprint window.

## üèóÔ∏è SOPHISTICATED VERSION CONTROL STRATEGY

### **Production Snapshot Protection Protocol**
**CRITICAL:** Current `main` branch ‚Üí Rename to `main-legacy-backup` (disaster recovery fallback)
**CRITICAL:** Create new `production-ready` branch ‚Üí New golden snapshot base for all development
**CRITICAL:** Tagged milestones every 4 hours ‚Üí Rollback points with verification

### **Branch Architecture (Phase-Based Development)**

```

### **Risk Mitigation Framework**
**ROLLBACK CAPABILITIES:**
- **Feature breaks** ‚Üí Revert to last checkpoint branch
- **Phase fails** ‚Üí Rollback to previous phase tag  
- **Complete disaster** ‚Üí Return to production-ready base
- **Nuclear fallback** ‚Üí Restore main-legacy-backup

### **Human-in-the-Loop Management Protocol**
**USER RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Create branches when AI requests them
- Confirm Lovable branch switches successfully
- Sync to GitHub at mandatory checkpoints
- Create tags for major milestones (v1.0-phase1-complete, etc.)
- Authorize phase completions and merges to production-ready

**QUALITY GATES (USER MUST CONFIRM):**
- **Hour 0:** Branch creation + production-ready base confirmation
- **Hour 4, 8, 12, 16, 20:** Mandatory GitHub sync + checkpoint validation
- **Hour 8, 16, 24:** Phase completion + tag creation + merge approval
