# üîç Sprint Preparation Phase - SPRINT-01-LAUNCH

This folder contains all diagnostic, analysis, and planning work completed during the preparation phase of Sprint 01.

## üìã Preparation Sequence

### Phase 1: System Diagnostics
**PHASE-1-DIAGNOSTIC-SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive analysis of current system state, identifying critical architectural failures and security vulnerabilities.

### Phase 2: Documentation Audit  
**PHASE-2-DOCUMENT-SCORING.md** - Scoring and validation of existing documentation accuracy, identifying gaps between documented and actual system state.

### Phase 2.5: Requirements Synthesis
**PHASE-2.5-INTENT-SYNTHESIS.md** - Synthesis of stakeholder requirements and technical constraints into actionable development priorities.

### Phase 3: Technical Alignment
**PHASE-3-ALIGNMENT-MAPPING.md** - Mapping of technical dependencies, architectural prerequisites, and implementation sequence planning.

### Phase 4: Sprint Planning
**PHASE-4-SPRINT-PLAN.md** - Final execution plan with phases, timelines, and validation checkpoints for sprint implementation.

## üéØ Preparation Outcomes

The preparation phase revealed critical architectural gaps requiring foundation-first development:

- **Authentication Crisis**: Missing role-based route protection and UI permission systems
- **Session Management Broken**: Incorrect user tracking and role correlation issues  
- **Component Security Missing**: Admin functions visible to all authenticated users
- **Kiosk Access Blocked**: Students cannot reach kiosk routes due to authentication barriers

## üìä Analysis Summary

**System Health**: Critical architectural failures preventing production deployment  
**Documentation Accuracy**: Significant gaps between documented and actual functionality  
**Implementation Priority**: Security boundaries and authentication foundation must precede all feature work  
**Risk Assessment**: High - core system workflows non-functional without architectural fixes

This preparation work established the foundation-first approach required for successful sprint execution.
