# 📊 System Architecture & User Journey Flowcharts

This folder contains visual diagrams mapping the BX-OS system architecture, user flows, and technical journeys across current and future states for Sprint 01.

## 📁 Organization

### 🔴 Current State Maps
- `01-current-authentication-routing.md` - Current broken auth & routing flows
- `02-current-kiosk-logic.md` - Static route kiosk implementation with issues
- `03-current-database-schema.md` - Complete ER diagram of existing tables
- `04-current-session-management.md` - Broken session tracking & user correlation

### 🟢 Future State: End of Sprint 01
- `05-updated-authentication.md` - Role-based routing & anonymous kiosk access
- `06-device-instance-management.md` - New dynamic kiosk assignment system
- `07-updated-kiosk-workflow.md` - Fixed kiosk user journey
- `08-fixed-session-management.md` - Corrected session architecture

### 🟣 Future Vision: Beyond Sprint 01
- `09-scalable-kiosk-architecture.md` - Multi-school deployment vision
- `10-behavior-analytics-flow.md` - AI analysis & pattern recognition
- `11-user-journey-map.md` - Complete student behavior support journey
- `12-system-integration-architecture.md` - External system integrations

## 🎨 Color Legend
- 🔴 **Red**: Problematic/broken areas requiring immediate fixes
- 🟢 **Green**: Post-sprint functionality (deliverable this sprint)
- 🟣 **Purple**: Future vision (beyond current sprint)
- 🔵 **Blue**: Security/compliance layers
- ⚪ **White**: Existing functional components

## 📋 Usage Notes
- All diagrams reflect actual code structure and database schema
- Flows are based on real implementation logic and documented requirements
- Future state diagrams include dependency requirements and implementation blockers
- Use these for sprint planning, architecture decisions, and stakeholder communication
