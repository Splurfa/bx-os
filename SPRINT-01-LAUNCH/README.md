# 🚀 SPRINT-01-LAUNCH

**Sprint Objective**: Establish foundational authentication architecture, fix critical security vulnerabilities, and restore core system functionality for production deployment.

## 📋 Sprint Overview

### Primary Goals
1. **Security Architecture Foundation**: Implement role-based route protection and UI permission systems
2. **Core Functionality Restoration**: Fix broken components and session management
3. **Authentication Crisis Resolution**: Enable proper user access patterns and anonymous kiosk functionality
4. **System Health Validation**: Ensure all critical workflows operational end-to-end

### Success Criteria
- Teachers cannot access Admin Dashboard
- Admins cannot access Teacher Dashboard  
- Students can access kiosk routes without authentication
- NotificationBell dropdown responds to user interactions
- Session tracking displays correct user information
- Queue management shows accurate student data

## 🎯 Implementation Status
