## Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

Netlify provides the easiest deployment with automatic updates and excellent performance.

1. **Create Netlify Account**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Connect your GitHub account if using version control

2. **Deploy from GitHub (If Available)**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" and authorize Netlify
   - Select the repository containing your application
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `dist`

3. **Deploy from Zip File**
   - If you have the application files as a zip:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the zip file onto the deployment area
   - Netlify will automatically extract and deploy

4. **Configure Domain**
   - **Default URL**: Netlify provides a random subdomain (e.g., `amazing-site-123.netlify.app`)
   - **Custom Domain**: Add your school domain in Site Settings → Domain Management
   - **SSL Certificate**: Automatically provisioned for all domains

5. **Verify Deployment**

### Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting

For schools with existing web hosting services:

1. **Build the Application**
   - Ensure you have the built application files (usually in a `dist` folder)
   - Files should include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets

2. **Upload Files**
   - Use FTP/SFTP to upload all files to your web server
   - Place files in the public web directory (often `public_html` or `www`)

3. **Configure URL Rewriting**
   - Add this to your `.htaccess` file for single-page application routing:
   ```
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   ```

4. **Test Deployment**
   - Visit your domain
   - Test all functionality
   - Verify SSL certificate is active

2. **Access Control**
   - Regularly review user accounts and permissions
   - Remove accounts for users who no longer need access
   - Use strong password requirements

3. **Domain Security**
   - Use your school's official domain
   - Consider subdomain usage (e.g., `behavior.yourschool.edu`)
   - Implement proper DNS security measures

### Performance Optimization

1. **Content Delivery**
   - Most hosting platforms provide global CDN automatically
   - Verify fast loading times from your location
   - Test during peak usage hours

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up basic uptime monitoring
   - Monitor system performance during school hours
   - Track user feedback on system responsiveness

3. **Scaling**
